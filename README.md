# SalcedoniaWP

## Synopsis
Worpress theme based on [*StanleyWP*](http://gentsthemes.com/demo/stanleywp/) theme that I've used in my personal blog: http://www.javiersalcedo.net

## Motivation
I decided to start a new project for my personal website including the following technologies that I wanted to explore:
* *Wordpress* for my personal blog
* *Bootstrap* to make the site responsive
* *Amazon Web Services* for the hosting

This personal blog would serve as portfolio of all my Open Source projects as well as a good occassion to get my hands dirty with actual web technologies as I have been working for 3 years as a backend developer in C++.

## Features
*StanleyWP* was a super cool Open Source Wordpress theme that served me well as a starting point for my responsive Worpress theme but, in my opinion it had several points that could be improved.
That's why, I decided to give it my personal _"touch"_ and to introduce the following features:
* New *About Me* template with parallax effect in the picture of the author of the blog.
* New color grey-blue-orange palette
* *Arvo* and *Open Sans* fonts
* Uses *FontAwesome*
* Uses *FancyBox* for the images and google maps galleries
* Forms validation in both *client* and *server* side with *bootstrap* error classes
* Includes a *top social menu* with a *toogleable twentyfifteen-like search panel*
* Scroll up button with animation to go to top
